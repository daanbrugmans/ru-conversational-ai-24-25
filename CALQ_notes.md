## Paper 2: Computing machinery and intelligence, by A. M. Turing
**C**ore quote(s):
- "What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in [the imitation] game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, 'Can machines think?""
- "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer [...], C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?"

**A**rgument(s): dr. Turing explores the concept of machine intelligence and how that may be defined.
He formulates the initial question of "Can machines think?" in such a way that we do not have to ponder about the definitions of "machines" and "think", but so that we can instead focus on trying to answer this question by using a hypothetical scenario called the "imitation game", nowadays called the Turing test, where a human interrogator attempts to correctly guess who of two people is a man and who is a woman, while only being able to communicate with them in a way that does not give away their identities.
While the imitation game would normally be performed by a set of three people, dr. Turing proposes that a (digital) computer may be able to substitute the role of the man, who normally attempts to deceive the interrogator into thinking they are a woman, but instead of two people attempting to convince the interrogator that they are not men, the computer and a human attempt to convince the interrogator that they are not computers; if the interrogator cannot correctly guess which is the computer, the computer wins the game.

The argument that dr. Turing makes here, in my view, would be this: if a computer could succeed at winning the imitation game reliably, meaning that a human interrogator would be unable to reliably conclude which of the participants is and isn't human, then it could be said that the computer's communicative abilities are on-par with a human's, and it could be said that that computer is able to act indistinguishably from a human participant.

**L**ink: The implications of the imitation game are very relevant to the course: a machine that passes the Turing test would be indistinguishable from a human, but that does not necessarily mean that it is the same as a human or works the same as a human.
Having a conversation with an artificial intelligence that can pass the Turing test may deceive the human participant into thinking that they are having a conversation with something that is human-like, despite that not being the case.
We have seen this happening with both ELIZA and ChatGPT, for example.
When designing conversational AI applications, we must keep in mind that the AI can *act like* or *talk like* a human *without actually **being*** human.
We must keep the sentiment of human users that may be deceived by the AI's human-like capabilities in mind by providing them with explanations on how the machine/computer/LLM works.

**Q**uestion(s): 
- Could we say that Weizenbaum's ELIZA has succeeded at the imitation game as Turing had described it? Since ELIZA was able to convince some people to think that it was human, one could say that it was able to pass the Turing test. How about ChatGPT when *it* was newly introduced to the public?
-  Not necessarily a question, but a potential point of discussion would be about the Chinese Room Experiment as a reaction to the imitation game.
